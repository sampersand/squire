I originally wanted to have "Knight" and "Squire" languages---the Knight would be simpler, and Squire would be more complex. However, I decided against it, as I like the purity of just Knight. 

So instead I decided to write this in one weekend. It turned out to be a fun project, but i never intended it to be anything. So I just keep adding to it without ever going back to refactor.

Possible additions:

- [x] Static fields on `form`s
- [ ] Inheritence for `form`s
- [x] macros
	- [x] Declarative
	- [x] Function
	- [ ] conditional compilation
	- [ ] `foreach`
	- [ ] `evaluate`
- [ ] pattern matching
- [ ] varidic functions and keyword parameters
- [ ] modules
- [x] dictionaries
- [x] interpolation
- [ ] overload
- [ ] pattern matching on functions


# Glossary
Squire doth contain a multitude of fancy parlance:
- `tome`s are dictionaries.
