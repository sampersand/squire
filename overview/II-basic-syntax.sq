# Naturally, Squire uses Roman Numerals for numbers.
six = VI;
fourteen = XIV;
proclaim("eighty four is: \(six * fourteen)"); #=> eighty four: is LXXXIV

# Just for sanity's sake, squire also supports zero and negative Roman Numerals.
proclaim("0=\(I-I), -1=\(I-II)") #=> 0=N, -1=-I

# If you wish to use arabic numerals, use the `arabic` function:
proclaim("eighty four is: \(arabic(six * fourteen))"); #=> eighty four is: 84
# There's also a `roman` function, which makes the roman numeral output explicit
proclaim("2+4=\(roman(2 + 4))"); #=> 2+4=VI


# Mr Boole was not alive in the middle ages. As such, we do not have "Booleans,"
# but instead have Veracity---the truthiness of something.
truth = yay;
falsehood = nay;
proclaim("is truth false? \(truth == falsehood)"); #=> is truth false? nay


# As an homage to the Knights of Ni, we use `ni` for nonexistent values:
proclaim("the knights of \(ni)!"); #=> the knights of ni!


# Quoted string literals don't have anything special---they support hex escapes,
# and most normal backslash escapes (eg `\t`). Interpolation is done via `\(`.
# Single quoted strings will only only interpret `\\` escapes for `'`, `"`, and
# `\` itself.
squire = "squire";
proclaim("What is cool? \(squire)!"); #=> What is cool? squire!
proclaim('What is cool? \(squire)!\t'); #=> What is cool? \(squire)!\t

# Squire also has *bare words*. However, they must be written in Fraktur unicode
# characters exclusively, which will be converted to their ASCII equivalents.
# Multiple words may be separated with whitespace, however leading and trailing
# whitespace will be stripped. 
squire = 𝔰𝔮𝔲𝔦𝔯𝔢 𝔦𝔰 𝔠𝔬𝔬𝔩;
proclaim("What is cool? \(squire)!"); #=> What is cool? squire is cool!


# Variables in Squire can be in whatever style you want---they're all the same!
foo_bar = X;
proclaim(foo-bar + fooBar + foo bar);#=> XXX

# You can also use `@__END__` to stop all parsing for the rest of the file.
